# Phishield-AI-Based-URL-Email-Threat-Detector
PhishShield is an AI-powered phishing detection system designed to identify malicious URLs and email messages in real time. It uses a combination of Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing to analyze URL structures, domain metadata, and linguistic patterns, going far beyond traditional blacklist-based approaches. The system extracts more than 20 lexical and technical features, processes text cues from emails, and uses trained ML models—such as Random Forest, Logistic Regression, SVM, and Naïve Bayes—to classify inputs as Safe, Suspicious, or Phishing with high accuracy. Built with Python and integrated into an interactive Streamlit interface, PhishShield provides a fast, lightweight, and deployable solution that adapts to modern threats, including zero-day phishing attacks. The project includes modular scripts for feature engineering, prediction, model training, and a clean UI, making it suitable for both research and real-world usage.
